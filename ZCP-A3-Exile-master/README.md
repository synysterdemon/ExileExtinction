### BE filters

These are kicks based on what i encountered:

on the line of 'isPlayer' add
```sqf
!="if (isPlayer _this) then {}"
```

on the line of 'units' add
```sqf
!="if (count units group _this>1) then"
```

#### Credits to the following people:

* JamieKG for Testing and XCAM Base.
* Zombie for AlRayak testing and whining.
* Ferry for 3 cap bases!
* DMS (Eraser, Defent) for code usage!

#### Changes in 2.1

* Amount of starting AI is now defined per mission instead of global..
* Code cleanup.
* Fixed cappoint not being capable ( problem with non private variables ).
* Allow multiple rewards for 1 mission.
* Option to deploy smokescreen per missions after finishing it.
* Option to pass list/array of basesfiles per mission (Instead of only Random or 1 basefile).
* No longer need to define baseType in the Cappoints array. It will auto determine it from the cappbases array.
* Add m3e export base support
* Option to disable damage when bombing is happening on map and build objects ( people and vehicles still die ).
* Added minimum distance check to Exile buildables
* Multiple static locations can be passed to 1 cappoint to be chosen randomly from the list.

* Amount of cappoints can now be relative to the amount of players online ( checks every x minuts ( default 10 minuts)
