*/
------------------------------------------------------------
05.07.2016 - v0054
+ Added: Adding/removing money to Bank via admin menu
+ Updated: when spectating you can see money on player, on bank and respect now!
+ Updated: you now have to hold SHIFT down now to drag and drop a vehicle / player on the map!
+ Updated: BE Filters
+ Made better: A lot of things within the background
------------------------------------------------------------
30.06.2016 - v0053
+ Updated: 0.9.8 "Kiwi" support
------------------------------------------------------------
28.06.2016 - v0052b
+ Added: TP Map selected Object
			When you have MapIcons turned on, you can select a player or vehicle by holding the left mouse button down on it, 
			when you release the mousebutton somewhere on the map, the selected object will be teleported to that location!
------------------------------------------------------------
26.06.2016 - v0052a
+ Updated: Fixed a bug where Anti TP was keeping people on spawn island (had to change anti-tp to counter new hacks)
+ Updated: BE Filters to work with Arsenal (I really got used to Arsenal, cool thing to have)
------------------------------------------------------------
26.06.2016 - v0052
++ FIXED: logging Admin Actions to a file (needed a small change)

+ Added: Revive (not fully tested yet) - if the target did not respawn yet and you are able to select him in the Admin Menu - you can revive him! :)
+ Added: a little edit field above the information of the selected vehicle / item in the admin spawn menu:
	https://share.infistar.de/XLdnADu5lAi57oW64YpaP.jpg
	It will allow you to select the classname and copy it, just incase you need that for custom scripts/editing!
+ Added: new info display when pressing shift + i
	it still shows information about "what you are aiming at" but a bit more beautiful and more information.
	https://share.infistar.de/SaS3eEAdpYUyFGQdeisZa.png
	especially usefull for base parts to find out who owns them and/or see if a door is locked etc.
+ Added: ZEUS (called it LIGHT) to Exile Admin Menu. To shoot a Lightning on a Location or Target.
	If you aim at something just hold  CTRL + press 1 - it will create a Lightning! - you can also just do it via admin menu
+ Added: "Unconscious" option to the Admin Menu (nice to punish player that do bad thigns at the trader)
	You will have to "Remove Unconscious" from a player or he will be Unconscious forever.
+ Added: "Remove Unconscious"

+ Updated: "delete" function on delete key.  In v51 it was not possible to delete a vehicle if a player was in it. Now it is working again.
+ Updated: fixbackpackduping: now working very well. (Especially for the Tanoa Map very important at the moment, due to APEX / DEV build bugs)
+ Updated: Anti Teleport - will now take care if surface is water or not
+ Updated: Anti Teleport - will now temp ban a player for 10 minutes if the player got logged at least 4 times for "POTENTIAL-TP-REVERTED1"

+ Updated: debug.sqf
+ Updated: BE Filters

------------------------------------------------------------
20.06.2016 - v0051
+ Added: experimental_dupe_check
	checking for duped backpacks and not taking any actions besides logging. Need to test more before It will start to remove duped items.
+ Added: "fixbackpackduping"
	Tells players to put their backpack down before looting a new one.
	If they have a backpack equipped and take a new one from the ground (for example) it would dupe the backpack (arma bug).
	This check will remove the backpacks from the groundweaponholder in that case (or vehicle, or safe or whatever the player might have taken the new backpack from)
+ Added: check that stops infiSTAR from starting if your Arma3 Server is below version 1.60 
+ Added: option to enable/disable the "drawing" check
+ Added: Admin power "Arsenal" - if you have it you can add an action on numpad , key that allows you to open the Arsenal
	(I had that in from testing and some people liked it so I kept it in)

+ Fixed: A bug in the Unfiform and Vest replacement.

+ Updated: how the restart and shutdown timer work
+ Updated: admin_showinfo function (Keybind for it is  shift + i), looking much better now with more information.
+ Updated: not saving support boxes automatically anymore. players need to "install" them to keep them (better imo)
+ Updated: BE Filters (scripts.txt)

+ Rage change: Removed a few lines from the scripts.txt, I am getting far to many people asking me questions about the stupid Battleye scripts.txt
	it is not my desire to do scripts.txt 24/7 for each different server/script.
	People that still hack and "bypass Battleye" surely know how to bypass the scripts.txt anyways.. so at the end of the day it probably just costs FPS and time.
------------------------------------------------------------
10.06.2016 - v0050B
+ Fixed: "Teleport - Target To Me"
+ Removed: productVersion check
+ Tweaked: Debug Console (F3)
+ Tweaked: Set many checks to false by default in the config (many people are not reading the config file.. not even when they have a problem. so this will make it easier for me)
+ Please replace your BE Filters (scripts.txt)
+ Updated a few minor things
------------------------------------------------------------
07.06.2016 - v0050A
+ Please replace your BE Filters (scripts.txt)
+ Updated a few minor things
------------------------------------------------------------
04.06.2016 - v0050
+ Added: Added productversion check to see if the Arma server and infiSTAR fit together
+ Fixed: A bug where some "MapIcons" buttons where not deleted when disabling the Icons (thanks to arma update)
+ Fixed: Vehicle Godmode
+ Fixed: Loot issues (dead body to close problem)
+ Fixed: ~picturething
+ Removed: VoiceOverNetwork blocking as it can now be done by Arma for example through the config (or description.ext or via script command, next Exile update will bring you another way to allow/disable that as well)
	description.ext Example (that file is in your MPMission!):

	0 = Global
	1 = Side
	2 = Command
	3 = Group
	4 = Vehicle
	5 = Direct
	6 = System // not  sure if one can still see systemMessage output by scripts if it is disabled, maybe better choice to not even touch that one?

	disableChannels[]={{0, true, true},{1, false, true},{2, true, true},{3, false, false},{4, false, false},{5, false, false},{6, true, true}};
	Enables text chat only on side, voice and text chat in vehicle, group and direct

+++ more.. :)
------------------------------------------------------------
02.06.2016 - v0049
+ Added: When a player draws on the map it will now delete the drawing and write the player name and uid in the hacklog! (just for global, side and commandchat)
+ Added: When a player places a marker it puts the player name within the markertext now! (just for global, side and commandchat)

	some more bad addons,
	check for locally created vehicles
+ Added: well readded the old vest & uniform bugfix as arma still seems to be broken.

+ IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
	MGT Dave and I found out that having a big "PROFILENAME.vars.Arma3Profile" on your server, causes desync up to massive desync.
	Looks like teleporting vehicles..
	If you know where to find that file on your server, just remove it. (Write a bat to do it before each restart?) somewhat like
	
	del /Q /F "PROFILENAME.vars.Arma3Profile"


+ added "USE_UID_WHITELIST" option incase you have a subscriber only server and want to kick people that are not white-listed when they try to connect.

+ updated an error where spawned vehicles were not saved to the database
------------------------------------------------------------

+ added "needAdminNameTag" somebody asked me if I could make it so his admins only have admin rights when they have a tag within their name, so I made this
+ added total connection counter for your players (logged in the ConnectLog, so you can see if a player that for example got caught for hacking was a new player or not)

+ added another "looking through wall" check (wall_look_2), this time for all objects (well those that considered objects by Arma) and not just Exile walls
	it will only force the player in first person if it triggers

~ modified "Player Low Rating!" check
------------------------------------------------------------
10.01.2016 - v0027A

~ fixed an issue related to: http://www.exilemod.com/topic/9980-players-kicked-to-lobby-randomly/
------------------------------------------------------------
08.01.2016 - v0027
*** reworked the antihack to use .hpp config file instead of an .sqf config file
** also using publicVariableServer to communitcate from Client to Server (again) 
	as remoteExecCall seems to be broken since 1.54 and causing server crahes/lags (read: https://pastebin.com/dMD6aq7p)
* make sure to news new MPMission files, BE filters, PBO basically if you update from an older version, check everything for changes.

Also make sure to have the config setup correctly!
If you have trouble like infiSTAR is not loading on your server, check your server.rpt file. It will show you your error/problem.

You need to set the serverCommandPassword to the serverCommandPassword you have in your servers Config.cfg
if there is no serverCommandPassword in your Config.cfg yet, set it like:
serverCommandPassword = "passwordhere";
